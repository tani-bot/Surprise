   - MEDIUM-2: In the Pincode check Page, Create a form t take inputs (pincode) and make an API call without using any 3rd party package(NO AXIOS) and display the location of that pincode
     Pincode API: https://api.postalpincode.in/pincode/500001
     Display only this : response[0].PostOffice[0].Block

3. HARD: Implement a basic Redux setup in this web app.
   The required packages are already installed.
   Is this your first time hearing about it? No issues, we are here to help you! Read up or watch online (Let us know if you need any help)
   If you know what we are talking about, try to store the previous Pincode into the redux after fetching the data from the API.

NOTE:

- We do NOT expect you to solve all the questions.
- Please take your time to learn TailwindCSS (which is very similar to Bootstrap) and Redux.

Try your best and Best of Luck!
